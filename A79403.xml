            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The King after a little pau≈øe, having again rai≈øed him≈øelf, with a ≈øerious eye did look upon them all, and ob≈øerving rain within door, and none without, he ≈øeemed to be much di≈øcontented at it, and thus again proceeded in his di≈øcour≈øe.</p>

The apprehen≈øion and horror of being damned (I do not ≈øay) will cure all other ≈øadne≈øs, but certainly it will ≈øwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it up, But I who by the mirits of my Redeemer, who by the grace of the Lord Je≈øus, do believe I ≈øhall be ≈øaved, I do de≈øire you to con≈øider with me, how great is my joy? how infinite my advantage is by this Exchange? How un≈øpeakable is the glory, and how excellent is the recompence for all the hard Marches, and the ≈øufferings in this world?</p>
            <p>My Lords! Take the coun≈øel with you of your dying Prince, let us prepare our ≈øelves again≈øt changes, always expecting them, that ≈øo we be not ≈øurpri≈øed when they come; Oh death how bitter art thou to a man who hath promi≈øed to him≈øelf ea≈øe and fulne≈øs, by his large po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, and to enjoy it for many years! it was a ≈øad Arre≈øt, that his ≈øoul was ≈øurpri≈øed the fir≈øt night.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider with me, that afflictions are often the occa≈øion of great ≈øpiritual advantages; We mu≈øt not look upon them, as they ≈øit heavy upon us, but as they ≈øerve unto Gods ends, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe of his eternal providence; When a Prince fights ju≈øtly, but un≈øucce≈ø≈øully; Could he but ≈øee the rea≈øon for which God did ≈øo order it, he would find it unrea≈øonable, nay ill, to have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe. If a man could have opened but one of the pages of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine coun≈øail, and ob≈øerved the event of <hi>Jo≈øephs</hi> being ≈øold to the Merchants of <hi>Amaleck,</hi> he might with much rea≈øon have dryed up the young mans tears; God e≈øteemeth it one of his glories, to bring good out of evil; And therefore it is but rea≈øon that we ≈øhould leave unto God the Government of his own world, as he him≈øelf plea≈øeth, and that we ≈øhould patiently wait till the change commeth, and not envy the happine≈øs, and pro≈øperity of our enemies, <hi>fret not thy ≈øelf</hi> (≈øaith that kingly Prophet) <hi>becau≈øe of him who pro≈øpereth in his ways, becau≈øe of him who bringeth wicked devices to pa≈øs for evil doers at the la≈øt, ≈øhall be rooted out, but tho≈øe that weight upon the Lord ≈øhal ≈øtand like Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>that cannot be ≈øhaken</hi>

            <p>The La≈øt great trial is Death, for which ≈øhould we grieve, it would be of all greifes the mo≈øt unrea≈øonable; For why ≈øhould we grieve at that which is ≈øo ab≈øolutely unavoydable? It is not ≈øo much to be cared for how long we live, as how well we live, for that life is not be≈øt which is the longe≈øt, but that which is mo≈øt vertuous, and honourable: The ≈øhortning of our dayes, is an evil, wholy depending upon opinion, let us ≈øtill be ready for death, and it cannot come too ≈øoon, for let us dye young or old, we have ≈øtill an immortal ≈øoul, and do lay down our bodyes onely for a time, as that which was the in≈øtrument of our cares and troubles, and the ≈øcene of ≈øickne≈øs, and di≈øea≈øe; Let us not then (my Lords) fear that which riddeth us of all the≈øe infirmities, for by fearing it, we ≈øhall never the ≈øooner avoid it, but make it more mi≈øerable. To dye is natural and nece≈ø≈øary, but to dye poorly and ba≈øely, is that alone which can make a man mi≈øerable. No man can be a ≈ølave, but he who feareth pain, or who feareth to dye, to ≈øuch a man nothing but peaceable times can denote his inclinations, or his duty, he dependeth onely on external things for his felicity, and therefore is no longer well, then during the plea≈øure of his Enemy, a Theife or a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>But ble≈ø≈øed is he who willingly re≈øigneth his ≈øoul into the hand of God which gave it, as into the hands of a ble≈ø≈øed Creator, and Redeemer: O ble≈ø≈øed Je≈øus thou did≈øt dye for me; grant that with joy I may ≈øubmit to thy Summons, for thou art as well my Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as my Judge, and came≈øt into the world to ≈øave ≈øinners; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg O Lord I am a great ≈øinner, but thy mercies are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. O God of mercy, and Father of all comfort, look upon the ≈øadne≈øs, and the ≈øorrowes of thy ≈øervant; my ≈øins lye heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and pre≈øs me ≈øore, by rea≈øon of thy hot di≈øplea≈øure. My af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflictions ≈øeem to be without comfort, becau≈øe they are the puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my ≈øins; My ≈øins have cau≈øed my ≈øorrow, yet my ≈øorrow doth not cure my ≈øins; and unle≈øs thou, O Lord, for thy own ≈øake, and meerly becau≈øe thou art good, art plea≈øed to pitty me, I ≈øhall be left forlorn, and as much without remedy as without comfort, Lord therefore pitty me; I deny my ≈øelf, and wholy depend on thee, and on the blood and merits of my redeemer: Let thy grace refre≈øh my ≈øpirit, thy comforts ≈øupport me, and thy mercies pardon me, for thou art g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od and gracious, and I throw my ≈øelf upon thy mercies. Suffer me not to let go my hold, and do thou with me, as ≈øeemeth good in thine own eyes. Thou art in finitely
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168824:5"/>more merciful then I can be mi≈øerable; O Lord make me the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thy mercies as well in my death, as in my life; And if even in this hour ≈øhall be plea≈øed to remove me from this vale of mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when my poor ≈øoul ≈øhall go out of the pri≈øon of this body, may it be received by Angels, and pre≈øerved from the horror and ≈øurprizal of evil ≈øpirits, and be laid up in the bo≈øome of our Lord, until the day of thy ≈øecond comming, when it ≈øhall be reunited to the body, which is now to be laid in the du≈øt, yet I doubt not but ≈øhall be rai≈øed up in joy, to live for ever, and behold the face of God, in the glories of our Lord Je≈øus, who is my Hope, my re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and life, my ble≈ø≈øed, and ever glorious Redeemer, to whom with the father, and the holy Spirit, be rendred all honour, and glory, now and for evermore.</p>
            <p>Having ≈øpoke the≈øe words, his Lords and privy Coun≈øelours (who ≈øtood round about his bed) were tran≈øported with as much admiration, as they were before with grief, and taking at that time, their leave of him, they left him with two of his Chaplains, who never cea≈øed to confirme him in his holy and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and to admini≈øter tho≈øe ≈øpiritual Con≈øolations to him which were ≈øuitable to the Ma≈øter of ≈øo great a war-fare, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conquered him≈øelf as well as his Enemies, ≈øtooped his anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed head, as low as death, and in the flouri≈øh of his years, wi≈øely exchanged a ≈øea of troubles in this world, for the heaven of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal re≈øt, and a temporal Crown for a crown of Immortality.</p>
